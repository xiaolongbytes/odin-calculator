Project Prompt: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

1. Implemented Reverse Polish Notation to compute results.
2. Used Flexbox to create the calculator UI.
3. Used git branch and pull requests to implement new features and address review comments.
4. Implemented button event listeners.

## Potential Feature Improvements:
- [ ] Clicking "=" displays the current/running value so that:
> 1 + 3 = 4  
> \+ 1 = 5
- [ ] For repeating digits: put line over the last digit
